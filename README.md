Let's focus on new starting/learning/ I've planned to start this coding repo one year ago. but due to some lazziness. that plann was dropped. Now Finally I decided to start writing this learning coding series. Hope you all will love my work.

SO about this python blogging series, Here I'm solving all the examples of the blog "Automate the Boring Stuff with the Python". Now you're curious why i choosed only this book ? because I'm exploring lots of site everyday. Through exploring i found some good useful sites for referencing best python tutorials/ documentations.
